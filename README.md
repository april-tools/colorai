# workshop-template

A Jekyll template for a simple workshop website, based on the [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), designed for hosting on [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Works best for about 5 pages of instructions, plus index, all written in Markdown. 
The navigation to the main pages is exposed at top and bottom of each page for easy stepping through the lessons.

> p.s. this is the minimal template--for a slightly more refined look, try the Bootstrap version [workshop-template-b](https://github.com/evanwill/workshop-template-b)

## Why?

Rather than making slides for a workshop, why not make a website? 
It's easier to write, access, share, and reuse. 
GitHub and gh-pages makes this super easy.

It is a better Open Educational Resource since anyone can fork and adapt!

## Details

The `workshop-template` [repository](https://github.com/evanwill/workshop-template) is a template project--to get started quickly, make a copy and fill in your own content and customizations.
The [site](https://evanwill.github.io/workshop-template/) demonstrates the output on gh-pages, and the content pages serve as examples.

Overview:

1. Copy the code to your own repository by clicking the green "Use this template" button (alternatively, import the [repository](https://github.com/evanwill/workshop-template) on GitHub or manually copy the files into a new repo).
2. Clone to your local machine, or work on the GitHub web interface to edit files.
3. Edit the `_config.yml` with your info.
4. Edit the content pages in markdown.
5. Add images to the "images" folder.
5. Push to GitHub (or commit on the web interface).
6. In your repo's settings, activate gh-pages, using main branch.

When creating content pages:

- to include a page in the nav, add `nav: true` to the file's yml front matter.
- the `title:` value will appear in the nav, sorted in the order of filenames. For simplicity use leading numbers in the lesson page filenames to create correct order.
- the default layout does not add `title` to the page, so it can be a short for the nav. 
Add a title in the Markdown content.

Using figure include:

- put all images in the `images` directory.
- figures will be centered, and can optionally be given a caption and percentage width.
- in a markdown file where you want the image to appear, use the `figure.html` include on its own line.
- pattern: `{% include figure.html file="my-cat.jpg" alt="cat" caption="My cat" width="50%" %}`

Basic style customization:

- the `main.scss` in the `css` folder exposes variables that can customize the basic style of website.
- Give a tiny splash of color on the header and footer borders by tweaking the `$border-color` 
- `$link-color` colors links

Using optional google analytics:

- add your analytics id to `_config.yml` in `google-analytics-id:` 
- if `google-analytics-id:` is blank, the ga code will not added
- analytics code will only be added when using "production" environment. This happens automatically on gh-pages. To build locally, use `JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build`

> Repository does not include a Gemfile because it is a very simple project. 
> Originally built using Ruby 2.3+ and Jekyll 3.4+; most recently used Jekyll 3.8.1.
