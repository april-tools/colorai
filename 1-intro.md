# Introduction

One amazingly useful GitHub feature is [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/){:target='_blank'}.
It provides free static web hosting from any repository.
Gh-pages is intended to host relatively simple sites for your GitHub portfolio, project, or documentation.
Because it is free and a valuable transferable skill, this is a great option for teaching and learning.

Many organizations are using GitHub to collaboratively create and publish instructional websites. 
For example: 

- [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/)
- [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/), [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/)
- this site!

> Note:
> There are *soft* limits and guidelines for gh-pages usage: sites should be < 1GB, use < 100GB bandwidth per month, and make < 10 builds per hour.
> If your site exceeds these quotas, GitHub will send you a notice asking you to modify the repository.
> All content must follow the [community guidelines](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/), e.g. no violence, obscene sex, or illegal stuff.

# workshop-template

`workshop-template` is a Jekyll project to create a simple workshop website, based on the [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima){:target='_blank'}, designed for hosting on [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target='_blank'}.

It works best for about 5 pages of instructions, plus index, all written in Markdown. 
The navigation to the main pages is exposed at top and bottom of each page for easy stepping through the lessons.

## Why?

Rather than making slides for a workshop, why not make a website? 
It's easier to write, access, share, and reuse. 
GitHub and gh-pages makes this super easy.

It is a better [Open Educational Resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources){:target='_blank'} since anyone can easily fork and adapt!
