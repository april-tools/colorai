Many of the recent advancements in AI are due to exploiting <i><b>structured low-rank representations</b></i>, from  low-rank tensor factorizations <cite>(Kolda and Bader 2009)</cite> for scaling large language models (LLMs), e.g., via adapters <cite>(Hu et al. 2021)</cite> or structured matrices
<cite>(Dao et al. 2022)</cite>; the diffusion of compact polynomial representations as powerful inductive biases for deep learning architectures <cite>(Cheng et al. 2024)</cite>; the emergence of probabilistic circuits to provide tractable probabilistic inference with guarantees <cite>(Loconte et al. 2024; Choi et al. 2020)</cite> and reliable neuro-symbolic AI <cite>(Ahmed et al. 2022)</cite>; and the wide application of tensor networks to solve and accelerate physics-related problems <cite>(Biamonte and Bergholm 2017)</cite> and quantum computing <cite>(Orus 2019)</cite>. 

### *"How are all these representations related to each others? and how can we transfer knowledge across communities?"*

We will try to answer the above questions in our day workshop at [the Thirty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/) (**AAAI-25**). The workshop will be held at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, March 3-4, 2025.
